# Crane API 🏗️

This is a very complex API that manages crane operations. Additionally, it stores the nuclear launch codes for the
Divided States of America for authorised users to access.

We use military-grade authentication to ensure that only the most trusted individuals can access the nuclear launch
codes.

There is a hosted version of the API by one of our contributors, but they are inactive and their server is currently down.
